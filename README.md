# Machine Learning Projects Repository

Welcome to the Machine Learning Projects Repository! This repository contains a collection of machine learning projects, each showcasing different algorithms and techniques commonly used in data analysis and predictive modeling. Below is a brief overview of the projects included in this repository:

## Projects Overview

1. **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) for Diabetes Prediction**: This project demonstrates the use of the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm to predict diabetes based on a dataset of medical variables.

2. **Logistic Regression for Weather Prediction**: Utilizes logistic regression to predict weather conditions based on temperature, humidity, and wind speed. It includes a Streamlit app for user interaction.

3. **Multiple Linear Regression for Startup Profit Prediction**: Predicts the profit of startups using multiple linear regression based on R&D spend, administration costs, marketing spend, and state. Also features a Streamlit app for user input and predictions.

4. **Polynomial Linear Regression for Salary Prediction**: Predicts salaries based on position levels using polynomial linear regression. Includes a Streamlit app for user input and predictions.

5. **Simple Linear Regression for Salary Prediction Based on Experience**: Predicts salaries based on years of experience using simple linear regression. Features a Streamlit app for user interaction and predictions.
